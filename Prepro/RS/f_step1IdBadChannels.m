function [badChanIdxs, badChanLbls] = f_step1IdBadChannels(pathStep0, nameStep0, chanInfo)
%Function that allows the user to perform bad channel identification in a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
%INPUTS:
%pathStep0 = Path of the .set that wants to be analyzed (either filtered and resampled, or just a copy of the original .set)
%nameStep0 = Name of the .set that wants to be analyzed (either filtered and resampled, or just a copy of the original .set)
%chanInfo: Information about bad channels. Can be:
%   -Emtpy/not given: There is no information about the channels
%   -A table (read from a .tsv format) containing channel information
%   -A vector with the indexes of the bad channels
%OUTPUTS:
%badChanIdxs: Indexes of the channels that were selected as bad channels by the user
%badChanLbls: Labels of the channels that were selected as bad channels by the user
