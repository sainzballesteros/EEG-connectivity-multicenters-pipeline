%Description:
%Function that trains a classifier to differentiate two conditions, and creates ROC curves and Feature Importance graphics
%The model trained is an XGBoosting algorithm, using a 80/20 Training/Test stratified split
%INPUTS:
%pathStep0          = String with the path were the files to train the model are located
%       NOTE: If the Step 0 (Feature Selection) was correctly completed, the path will correspond to the Step0_FeatureSelection
%       If the Step 0 was not completed, the path will correspond to the main folder of connectivity metrics
%nameStep0          = String with the name of the .csv file that contains the data to train the model
%       NOTE: The .csv is a matrix of [Subjects, Features], where the first  column corresponds to the diagnostics/comparisons/labels
%       NOTE: nameStep0 can also be a cell with multiple .csv, and the user will be asked to pick one
%       If the Step 0 was not completed, nameStep0 will be empty, as the data will be loaded from each sub-# folder
%pathStep1          = String with the path where the .jpg with the ROC Curves and Feature Importance graphics will be stored 
%classDxComparison  = Cell of 2x1, each field containing strings of the diagnostics to be compared ({} by default)
%classCrossValFolds = Number of Cross-Validation folds to use for creating the ROC curves (5 by Default)
%databasePath       = Path of the desired database that wants to be used
%       NOTE: The databasePath MUST already be in a BIDS-like structure
%       NOTE: databasePath will be only used if the user wants to use the complete connectivity metrics
%BIDSmodality       = String with the modality of the data that will be analyzed (used in sub-#_BIDStask_BIDSmodality.set) ('eeg' by default)
%       NOTE: BIDSmodality will be only used if the user wants to use the complete connectivity metrics

%OUTPUTS:

%subjPerDx          = Number of subjects used per category/diagnosis/outcome/condition
%Also saves the following metrics for the model: ROC_Curve.jpg, AllFeaturesImportance.jpg, and SHAP_BestFeaturesImportance.jpg
