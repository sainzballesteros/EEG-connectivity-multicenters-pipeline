    f_mainPatientControlNorm(controlPaths, controlNames, remainingPaths, remainingNames, normFactor, realMinDuration)
%Description:
%Function that performs control-patient normalization of a given nationality and saves the results
%INPUTS:
%controlPaths = Cell of 1xN containing the paths of the controls of a given nationality
%controlNames = Cell of 1xN containing the .set names of the controls of a given nationality
%remainingPaths = Cell of 1xN containing the paths of the remaining subjects (non-controls) of a given nationality
%remainingNames = Cell of 1xN containing the .set names of the remaining subjects (non-controls) of a given nationality
%normFactor = String with the normalization factor desired (regular 'z-score' by default)
%       All the metrics are calculated for the CONTROLS only, and applied (divided) for all subjects
%       'Z-SCORE': Subtrates the mean and divides by the standard deviation
%       'UN_ALL': Uniform scaling of channel data by dividing by the robust standard deviation of concatenated channel data
%       'PER_CH': Dividing each channel by the MAD of its continuous activity across the whole recording
%       'UN_CH_HB': Uniform scaling of all channels by dividing all channel data by the Huber mean of channel robust standard 
%                   deviation values (same scaling applied to all channels).
%       'RSTD_EP_Mean': Normalizes by taking the mean of each N subject's robust standard deviation per channel individually
%       'RSTD_EP_Huber': Normalizes by taking the Huber mean of each N subject's robust standard deviation per channel individually
%       'RSTD_EP_L2': Normalizes by taking the Euclidean mean of each N subject's robust standard deviation per channel individually
%realMinDuration    = Real minimal duration of the .sets (must be equal or greater than 240)
%OUTPUTS:
%status: 1 if the script was completed successfully, 0 otherwise
%normData: Structure with 2 fields: Controls and Remaining. Each field has a matrix of [channels, time, subjects] already normalized.
%normTable: Table with the metrics to evaluate the performance of the normalization [2, numMetrics]
%finalPaths: Structure with 2 fields: Controls and Remaining. Each field has a cell with the subject paths that were used to generate normData'
%finalNames: Structure with 2 fields: Controls and Remaining. Each field has a cell with the subject names that were used to generate normData'
